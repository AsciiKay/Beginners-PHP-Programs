NOTE:
To make any project work :

You need apache server installed and php installed too!
You need to copy all the files to /var/www/html folder in linux, "Search internet for macos or windows"
Then restart the apache server (optional)
Then type localhost:portnumber/(main_html_index_page).html/ in the browser to make it work!
And then BRAVO!

ENJOY!
